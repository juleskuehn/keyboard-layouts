This keyboard layout testing tool was designed for English layouts and ANSI keyboards only.  Due to demand from European users I am adding some features to accomodate ISO keyboards and non-English layouts.  Check back soon!

##Bug fixes underway
- "-" and "=" keys do not fire for some users
- bépo->qwerty and azerty->qwerty number row
- qwerty->bépo and qwerty->azerty accentuated keys
- altGr and dead keys support

##Contribute
Report bugs, request features and contribute layouts on [github](https://github.com/mikekuehn/keyboard-layouts/).
